To get your course added to the [Races](/races) page, make sure it meets the
following criteria:
1. Course is "Visible to Public"
2. Start date/time is correct
3. Terrain factors are consistent with the guidance in the [About the models
section](/docs/models)

Then just contact me and let me know, and I'll add it. Reach out if you need
help.
